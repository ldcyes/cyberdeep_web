And this year we're making O_O all about <em>speed</em>.</p>\n<p>Every year O_O has introduced developers to the world of making Obsidian plugins. Today, there are nearly 2,000 community-built plugins. We never imagined that the ecosystem would be so rich and expansive.</p>\n<p>So this year, we're switching things up. We want to encourage the developer community to revisit existing plugins to make them even better.</p>\n<p>In the last few months, we have put a major emphasis on app performance while continuing to expand the <a href=\"https://docs.obsidian.md/\">plugin API</a>. We want to see more plugins adopt these new APIs, and focus on creating a snappy experience.</p>\n<p>This month you can join Obsidian October in the following ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for a plugin critique.</strong> If you want to have your plugin critiqued by the Obsidian team, <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/840286264964022302/1290743805708079198\">sign up on Discord</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Self-assessment.</strong> Follow our checklists to improve your plugin, theme, or vault:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.obsidian.md/oo24/plugin\">Plugin checklist</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.obsidian.md/oo24/theme\">Theme checklist</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.obsidian.md/oo24/vault\">Vault checklist</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Join new Discord channels</strong> to <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/1290740823893344378\">showcase your project</a> and <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/1290741034720039022\">chat with other participants</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>We hope everyone has a great time! üçª</p>\n",

Our add-on services <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/sync\">Obsidian Sync</a> and <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/publish\">Publish</a> allow us to remain <a href=\"https://stephango.com/vcware\">100% user-supported</a>, and help us fund continued development.</p>\n<p>Because Obsidian is built on local files that you control, our add-on services have many free alternatives and self-hostable options.

You can upgrade at any time and pricing is prorated.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I downgrade from Plus to Standard?</strong><br />\nYes. To downgrade you must first make sure that your account meets the constraints of the Standard plan ‚Äî meaning that you have only 1 remote vault with less than 1 GB used.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I retain 50GB of storage if I downgrade to Standard?</strong><br />\nNo. If you are an early supporter and purchased the Plus plan with 50 GB before January 1st 2024, you must remain on the Plus plan to continue receiving 50 GB of storage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>More questions?

			"content_html": "<p>Today we're excited to announce that the <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/canvas\">Obsidian Canvas</a> file format is now called <a href=\"https://jsoncanvas.org/\">JSON Canvas</a> and has its own site, specification, and open source resources at <a href=\"https://jsoncanvas.org/\">jsoncanvas.org</a>.</p>\n<p>JSON Canvas can be implemented freely as an import, export, and storage format for <a href=\"https://jsoncanvas.org/docs/apps/\">any app or tool</a>. All the resources associated with JSON Canvas are open source under the MIT license, and can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/obsidianmd/jsoncanvas\">on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>For the <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/changelog/2022-12-05-desktop-v1.1.0/\">release</a> of Obsidian Canvas we created the <code>.canvas</code> format with an open spec. We created this format because we felt it was essential to follow the <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/about\">principles</a> that have guided us since the start. Your Obsidian data should always be stored locally, accessible offline, completely in your control, in open file formats that are <a href=\"https://stephango.com/file-over-app\">easy to retrieve and read</a>. For notes we achieve this by using plain text <code>.md</code> files with Markdown syntax, a widely supported format. However, infinite canvas data does not yet have a similarly established format.</p>\n<p>While infinite canvas tools are not new, they have been quickly <a href=\"https://infinitecanvas.tools/\">growing in popularity</a>. The JSON Canvas format was created in hopes of providing longevity, readability, interoperability, and extensibility to data created with infinite canvas apps. The format is designed to be easy to parse and give users ownership over their data.</p>\n<p>The JSON Canvas spec is currently at <a href=\"https://jsoncanvas.org/spec/1.0\">version 1.0</a>. The spec is relatively conservative, it does not support every feature that canvas apps may want to implement. However we think it is a useful starting point to build upon, and we plan to continue improving on it over time.</p>\n",

Since the start, Obsidian has been built to give you full control over your data, without the requirement to sign up for an account or share any private information.</p>\n<p>Our new <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/security\">Security page</a> compiles information about how Obsidian approaches protecting your data. It is also the home for security audits completed by third parties. Our first audit by Cure53 is now available, and detailed below.</p>\n<p>We make Obsidian so that we can capture our own private thoughts and ideas. Independent audits help us ensure that our code and procedures meet the highest security standards. We will continue working with industry-leading security firms on more audits that provide comprehensive coverage and transparency towards this commitment.</p>\n<h3>Independent audit of Obsidian apps by Cure53</h3>\n<p>We asked the Berlin-based security firm <a href=\"https://cure53.de/\">Cure53</a> to perform a penetration test and source code audit of the Obsidian apps. A future report will provide an audit of the Obsidian Sync server.</p>\n<p>We invite you to read <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/files/security/2023-11-Obsidian-Cure53-Audit-Summary.pdf\">a summary of the findings</a> and the <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/files/security/2023-11-Obsidian-Cure53-Audit-Full.pdf\">full report</a>. The project concluded in late December 2023, with fixes incorporated into <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/changelog/2023-12-26-desktop-v1.5.3/\">Obsidian 1.5.3</a> released publicly on December 26th, 2023.</p>\n<p>During the audit, the Cure53 team discovered four vulnerabilities that were promptly resolved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CORS bypass via flawed URL validation</li>\n<li>Arbitrary file read via local file embedding</li>\n<li>Arbitrary file write via path traversal in Sync plugin</li>\n<li>App protocol origin leak via CSS snippets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We're proud to report that the Cure53 team reviewed the resolutions and concluded that their recommendations have been properly followed. From the report summary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As the final phase of this project, in late December 2023, Cure53 conducted a remediation verification phase to examine how the Obsidian scope has improved over time and in relation to the findings communicated. In this area, the audit team is pleased to report that all vulnerabilities have been properly addressed and the recommendations from the assessment have been properly followed. Cure53 was able to review the diffs created by the Obsidian team to fix the reported issues and was therefore able to make reliable judgments about the quality of the fixes.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of the Cure53 team, appropriate steps have been taken to ensure that good fixes have been created and are now in effect for the Obsidian clients, UI and features.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We look forward to publishing more security audits and updates, so you can continue to feel confident trusting Obsidian apps and services.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://obsidian.md/sync\">Obsidian Sync</a> makes it easy to securely sync your Obsidian data across all major mobile and desktop platforms with end-to-end encryption, version history, and granular settings per device. Today we're excited to share a host of improvements to Obsidian Sync.</p>\n<h3>What's new?</h3>\n<p>Over the next few weeks, we will be updating Obsidian Sync to support the following improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More vaults.</strong> Vault limit has increased from 5 to 10 vaults.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible storage.</strong> Per-vault storage limits have changed to a single account-wide storage limit. This means you can allocate your storage any way you want across all your vaults.</li>\n<li><strong>More storage options.</strong> Vault storage will be expandable up to 100 GB.</li>\n<li><strong>Bigger files.</strong> Maximum file size is doubling from 100 MB to 200 MB.</li>\n<li><strong>Closer servers.</strong> You can sync faster by choosing your region. Options will include North America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Starting in January 2024, these will be the new Sync plans:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10 GB for $10/mo, or $8/mo billed yearly</li>\n<li>100 GB for $20/mo, or $16/mo billed yearly</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Join Sync now for an early supporter holiday deal</h3>\n<p>If you <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/pricing\">sign up for Obsidian Sync</a> between now and January 1st, 2024, you will get 50 GB of storage for $10/mo or $8/mo billed yearly.</p>\n<p>If you are a current Sync subscriber your plan has automatically been upgraded to 50 GB of flexible storage, 10 vaults, and increased file size limit. Your pricing will not change, including any discounts you have.</p>\n<p>Happy holidays, and thank you for being an early supporter!</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/Licenses+and+payment/Gifting\">gift Sync to your friends and family</a> with this early supporter benefit through the end of the year.</p>\n<h3>About these changes</h3>\n<p>With these new plans, our goal is to continue offering more flexibility and speed while maintaining the price we launched with in 2020.</p>\n<p>As Obsidian has grown beyond <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/blog/new-obsidian-icon/\">a million users</a> we have seen a growing variety in vault sizes and storage needs. Some people prefer one large vault, while others split their work across many vaults. Some people are strict text-only writers, while others love working with images, audio, video, and our <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/changelog/2023-05-09-desktop-v1.3/\">recently improved PDF capabilities</a>. This variety of use cases made it clear that Sync should grow beyond a one-size-fits-all plan.</p>\n<p>Previously, the 5 vault limit and 10 GB per vault made Obsidian Sync too restrictive for some users. By making Sync more flexible we're excited to see what new use cases open up.</p>\n<h3>FAQs</h3>\n<p><strong>Q: As a current user do I need to do anything special to access the new plan and features?</strong><br />\nA: As a current Sync subscriber, your account will be automatically upgraded to 10 vaults with 50 GB of flexible storage. There will be no changes in pricing at your next renewal. All discounts are preserved.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do these new plans affect early bird pricing, non-profit, or educational discounts?</strong><br />\nA: Any discounts on your account are still applied to the new plans. Your existing pricing will remain unchanged. If you upgrade to 100 GB of storage you will still benefit from the discounts on your account.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: If I cancel my 50 GB plan can I sign up for it again?</strong><br />\nA: No. If you cancel your 50 GB plan, it will no longer be available to you. Starting in January 2024, you will only have access to the new 10 GB and 100 GB storage options.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I switch between monthly and yearly billing without losing my plan?</strong><br />\nA: Yes. You can switch between monthly and yearly billing (or vice versa) without affecting your plan features or any discount you may have.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How can I change the server region for my Sync vault?</strong><br />\nA: You can only select a server region when you initially set up Sync. If you need to change servers you'll need to create a new remote vault and re-upload your vault data. Unfortunately you will lose version history if you do so. We do not currently offer a way to migrate your vault to a different region.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Does the Sync server region affect the security or privacy of my data?</strong><br />\nA: No. Sync uses the same end-to-end encryption and <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Sync/Security+and+privacy\">approach to security and privacy</a> regardless of the server region.</p>\n",

Of course, source mode will remain an option if you're looking for a strictly plain text experience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://obsidian.md/images/blog/table-editing.gif\" alt=\"Table editing experience sneak peek\" /></p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/import\">Obsidian Importer</a> allows you to convert your data from a variety of proprietary formats to portable, durable files. These files work with any Markdown app, so you have control over your data, and are not locked into any tool.</p>\n<p>Today we're excited to share that Importer now works with Apple Notes, and is compatible with its many content types ‚Äî including internal links added in iOS 17. See our guide: <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/import/apple-notes\">How to convert your Apple Notes to Obsidian</a>.</p>\n<p>Three months ago, <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/blog/free-your-notes\">we introduced Importer</a> as an <a href=\"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-importer\">open-source project</a>. Thanks to contributions from the Obsidian community, Importer supports converting your data from <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/import/notion\">Notion</a>, <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/import/evernote\">Evernote</a>, <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/import/google-keep\">Google Keep</a>, <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/import/onenote\">Microsoft OneNote</a>, <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/import/bear\">Bear</a>, <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/import/roam\">Roam Research</a>, <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/import/html\">HTML files</a>, <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/import\">and more</a>.</p>\n<p>The latest version of Importer tackles the most challenging format to date: Apple Notes.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Apple Notes is one of the few note-taking apps that does not have a built-in export feature. Because Apple Notes uses a proprietary format, it makes data complicated to migrate, and nearly impossible to use in conjunction with other tools.</p>\n<p>Apple Notes supports content such as tables, images, drawings, scans, and PDFs. As of iOS 17 it also supports links between notes. This breadth of content makes the conversion process more challenging. Here's the good news: all of these content types can now be extracted using Obsidian Importer.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://obsidian.md/images/blog/import-apple-notes.png\" alt=\"Obsidian Importer showing Apple Notes import\" /></p>\n<p>So, how does it work? Apple Notes stores your data in a local SQLite database. This data is in an undocumented format, but it's possible to decode how it is stored and convert it. Decoding the Protocol Buffers stored in the Apple Notes database was made possible by <a href=\"https://github.com/threeplanetssoftware/apple_cloud_notes_parser\">the work of Jon Baumann</a> from <a href=\"https://www.ciofecaforensics.com/\">Ciofeca Forensics</a> and its <a href=\"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-importer/pull/125\">adaptation for Obsidian</a> by <a href=\"https://novov.me/\">Mir Novov</a>.</p>\n<p>Whether you're planning to migrate away from Apple Notes or just want to back up your data, the new Obsidian Importer gives you the freedom to easily convert your Apple Notes to portable, durable files.</p>\n",

			"title": "How to verify Obsidian Sync&#39;s end-to-end encryption",
			"content_html": "<p>On our <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">About page</a>, we describe the guiding principles that have shaped Obsidian since the start. Privacy is one of these principles, and we go to great lengths to make sure we can uphold this statement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We believe that your thoughts and ideas belong to you and deserve complete privacy. That's why your data is stored on your device, inaccessible to us. When you use our online services, your data is protected with end-to-end encryption for maximum security.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When you use <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/sync\">Obsidian Sync</a>, your data is end-to-end encrypted. But how can you be sure that is true?</p>\n<p>In this guide, we provide step-by-step instructions so that you can trustlessly verify the end-to-end encryption of your data when it is sent and received via our Sync servers.</p>\n<h3>How Obsidian Sync works</h3>\n<p>Let's review how Obsidian Sync encryption works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You provide a vault password, or let our managed server generate one for you. This password is separate from your account password and is only used for establishing a remote vault.</li>\n<li>The Obsidian app generates a unique <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)\">salt</a> for each vault. A salt is random data used to protect your password by mixing it with your password before hashing.</li>\n<li>Your encryption key is derived from your password + salt using an algorithm called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt\">scrypt</a>.</li>\n<li>This encryption key is used to encrypt/decrypt data with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard\">AES-256</a> using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode\">Galois/Counter Mode</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the next few steps, you'll learn how to get your vault's salt, and test the encryption of your data.</p>\n<h3>Getting your vault's salt</h3>\n<p>First, get the salt used to derive your encryption key by following these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure that Obsidian Sync is turned on.</li>\n<li>Open Developer Tools in the Obsidian app using the hotkey <kbd>Cmd+Opt+I</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd> on Windows.</li>\n<li>Go to the Console and run the following code, by copy/pasting it and pressing the Return key:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">let data = await (await fetch('https://api.obsidian.md/vault/list', {method:'POST', headers: {'Content-Type':'application/json'}, body: JSON.stringify({token: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('obsidian-account')).token})})).json();\nlet vaults = [].concat(data.shared, data.vaults);\nlet vault = vaults.find(v =&gt; v.id === app.internalPlugins.getEnabledPluginById('sync').vaultId);\nconsole.log(`The salt of your vault ${vault.name} is: &quot;${vault.salt}&quot;`);\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should see a message containing your salt:</p>\n<pre><code>The salt of your vault Notes is: &quot;8II2%?YeNpddlbd@4Z)c&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Decrypting data</h3>\n<p>Next, find an example of a sync event and decrypt it. Here we will use the Network tab of Developers Tools. This is where all sync events are logged, so you can see data that is being sent and received by the Obsidian app, and confirm that it is using your encryption key.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the Network tab of the Developer Tools, and filter by &quot;WS&quot; types (for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket\">WebSocket</a>).</li>\n<li>Find the WebSocket connection to Obsidian Sync. It will look like <code>sync-xx.obsidian.md</code> ‚Äî you may need to reload Obsidian to see it.</li>\n<li>In the WebSocket data stream, go to the Message tab. There you will see binary messages of uploads and downloads. If you aren't seeing them, you can easily trigger one by modifying any synced note in your vault.</li>\n<li>Right click on one of them and choose <code>Copy message &gt; Copy as Base64</code>.</li>\n<li>Using the following code, enter your password, your salt, and base64 binary data, and run the decryption routine in the Console (alternatively you can run it in a NodeJS prompt or script).</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Use the standard crypto package from NodeJS\nlet crypto = require('crypto');\n\n// Enter your password, salt, and binary data as base64\nlet password = 'E@QAXVBo44PQtzS6EAyU';\nlet salt = '8II2%?YeNpddlbd@4Z)c';\nlet data = Buffer.from('ApLmsQVGwGHmjb7jM4G2ZXnl2+Wi8CJMZSbgCTvcBHendXw01iNw3oWQ8Y8gW1tS7f/OMly1n4KoNhjy', 'base64');\n\n// Derive the encryption/decryption key from your password and salt\nlet key = crypto.scryptSync(Buffer.from(password.normalize('NFKC'), 'utf8'), Buffer.from(salt.normalize('NFKC'), 'utf8'),\n  32, {N: 32768, r: 8, p: 1, maxmem: 128 * 32768 * 8 * 2});\n\n// Split up the data blob into the 12-bytes IV, the encrypted data, and the 16-bytes auth tag.\nlet iv = data.subarray(0, 12);\nlet encryptedData = data.subarray(12, data.length - 16);\nlet authTag = data.subarray(data.length - 16);\n\n// Decrypt the data\nlet decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('aes-256-gcm', key, iv);\ndecipher.setAuthTag(authTag);\nlet decrypted = Buffer.concat([decipher.update(encryptedData), decipher.final()]);\n\n// Print it to a string\nconsole.log(decrypted.toString('utf8'));\n</code></pre>\n<p>The data that is returned should be a revision of a file that was sent or received via the Obsidian Sync's servers. That's it! If it properly decrypts, you'll know your encryption key is working.</p>\n",

If you want your writing to still be readable on a computer from the 2060s or 2160s, we think it's important that your Obsidian notes can be read on a computer from the 1960s.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://obsidian.md/images/2023-06-logo-reductions.png\" alt=\"Obsidian logo reduced to single color\" /></p>\n<p>The new logo is designed to remain legible when reduced to single color applications ‚Äî because it too should have looked groovy in the 60s.</p>\n<h3>Sharpen your thinking</h3>\n<p>Extending the metaphor of obsidian tools, our ambition is for Obsidian to be the tool that helps you think more clearly. As a material, obsidian is shaped using a technique called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapping\">knapping</a>, chipping off flakes of rock to create sharp edges.</p>\n<p>Obsidian aims to help you hone your thoughts and refine your ideas with precision. The new icon represents a practical, user-friendly tool that helps you cut through the clutter and carve out clear ideas.</p>\n<h3>You shape your tools, and they shape you</h3>\n<p>We believe that Obsidian should adapt to your way of thinking, not the other way around. That's why we focus on making Obsidian highly customizable and extensible, so you can shape it to your unique needs.</p>\n<p>Like the app itself, the new Obsidian icon is malleable. It can be personalized to reflect your favorite color scheme. With our <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/brand\">customizable vector files</a>, you can tailor the Obsidian icon to your liking. Give it a try!</p>\n<div class=\"card card-logo my-16 mx-auto flex items-center justify-center rounded-[20%] w-48 h-48 lg:w-64 lg:h-64\"> \n<svg id=\"custom-logo\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\"

I want to see what happens if more people gain that superpower.</p>\n<p>Silver and Licat aren‚Äôt going anywhere, quite the opposite! As I take on this role, Silver and Licat will have more time to do what they do best ‚Äî building the amazing product and community we all love.</p>\n<p>You may know me from Minimal and my contributions to Obsidian 1.0, but I‚Äôve spent about 20 years building companies, and learned a lot along the way. Obsidian is built on strong values. My goal is to create the structure that helps us uphold those values for as long as possible.</p>\n<p>Obsidian is, and will continue to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free for personal use</li>\n<li>Built on durable, open file formats without lock-in</li>\n<li>Private, offline-first, and E2E encrypted</li>\n<li>Endlessly customizable via API/plugins</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Above all, Obsidian is 100% user-supported. There are no investors pushing us to compromise on these values.</p>\n<p>I believe these strong values are why Obsidian has such a kind and dedicated community. It‚Äôs genuinely one of the most generous and friendly places online.</p>\n<p>There is nothing I‚Äôd rather do than help Obsidian fulfill its potential, and I‚Äôm excited to commit myself to it fully.</p>\n",

			"title": "1.0 Theme migration guide",
			"content_html": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Obsidian 1.0 introduces a new default theme, a new theme versioning system, and several important new features. We expect that most themes and plugins will need some tweaks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Migrating your theme to the new versioning system</li>\n<li>How to design themes for v1.0+</li>\n<li>New v1.0 features and modes to consider</li>\n<li>Design guidelines</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Migrating your theme to the new versioning system</h2>\n<p>Because v1.0 contains a lot of breaking changes, we are taking this time to reset our theme gallery and improve how themes are loaded in Obsidian going forward.</p>\n<p>Themes that are not compatible with v1.0 have been flagged in the <code>community-css-themes.json</code> file as &quot;legacy.&quot; Legacy themes are hidden from the gallery until the theme author updates the theme opts to have the flag removed.</p>\n<p>Even if your theme made the cut to the new list, we still recommend you take the following steps to prepare your theme for the new version of Obsidian:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a copy of your <code>obsidian.css</code> file and rename it to <code>theme.css</code>. Keep the <code>obsidian.css</code> file in your repository so that older versions of Obsidian can continue to download your theme. If you have any preprocessing tools that output the <code>obsidian.css</code> file, make sure to update those as well.</li>\n<li>Test your theme on Obsidian 1.0 and apply any issues to <code>theme.css</code>.</li>\n<li>Create a <strong><code>manifest.json</code></strong> file in your repository. This file specifies the <code>minAppVersion</code> for your theme, meaning: versions of Obsidian that are older than the version you specify will not be able to install your theme.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Sample Manifest.json</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{  \n   &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Sample Theme&quot;,  \n   &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,  \n   &quot;minAppVersion&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,  \n   &quot;author&quot;: &quot;Obsidian&quot;,  \n   &quot;authorUrl&quot;: &quot;https://obsidian.md&quot;  \n}\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><em>Optional:</em> Update your screenshot thumbnail. This should be 16:9 aspect ratio and the recommend size is 512 by 288px.</li>\n<li>Update your theme's README file. Clicking on the theme in the Theme Gallery will now the README file from Github. This means you have more space to promote your theme and can load additional screenshots to showcase different features.</li>\n<li>Create a Pull Request on the <code>obsidian-releases</code> repo and remove <code>&quot;legacy&quot;: true</code> from your  theme entry in <code>community-themes.json</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to design themes for v1.0+</h2>\n<p><strong>TLDR: Obsidian 1.0 introduces over 400 new CSS variables that help you style almost every aspect of the Obsidian UI. This enables themes to remove complex selectors and let variables do the heavy lifting.</strong></p>\n<p>With the release of Obsidian v1.0 we‚Äôve made it much easier to create custom themes and snippets.</p>\n<p>Previously, many of Obsidian‚Äôs UI elements could only be targeted by writing complex CSS selectors with high specificity. Several selectors were typically required to target the same element across Reading mode and Live Preview.</p>\n<p>With v1.0 we have abstracted most UI elements into CSS variables applied to the <code>body</code> element. You can find an alphabetized list of all the CSS variables at the top of the <code>app.css</code> file. These variables are also designed to provide parity across Reading mode and Live Preview.</p>\n<p>Our goal was to make it possible to create highly expressive themes with less specificity in your CSS selectors. Most themes should be able to completely customize the interface by simply targeting <code>body</code> for interface styling, and <code>.theme-light</code>/<code>.theme-dark</code> for colors.</p>\n<p>We expect these changes to significantly reduce the number of lines of code in advanced themes. This should reduce maintainance work and make your code more future-proof.</p>\n<p>If you are working on a complex theme, consider simplifying your selectors and using the new CSS variables to do the heavy lifting. The new CSS variables should also make it easier to create styles that are responsive to conditional CSS classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explore the new variables in CSS by looking at <code>app.css</code> and using the Developer Tools</li>\n<li>Try to use the lowest specificity selectors you can. You may be able to only use <code>body</code>, <code>.theme-light</code> and <code>.theme-dark</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New 1.0 features and modes to consider</h2>\n<p>Obsidian 1.0 contains new features and modes that you should consider in your theme.</p>\n<h4>Accent color</h4>\n<p>Users can now customize their accent color. Dynamic variables for accent HSL values <code>--accent-h</code>, <code>--accent-s</code>, <code>--accent-l</code> are provided which can be modified with the CSS <code>calc()</code> function.</p>\n<p>If you define these variables in your theme, the user will see your default accent color, and resetting to default will return the user to your specified default accent color.</p>\n<h4>Title bar style</h4>\n<p>In <code>Settings &gt; Appearance</code> users can now choose between three different title bar styles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hidden:</strong> no titlebar is displayed, only the the top row of tabs, default in 1.0+</li>\n<li><strong>Custom:</strong> displays a custom titlebar element that can be styled with CSS (previously the default in versions 0.15 and older)</li>\n<li><strong>Native:</strong> displays the native operating system titlebar</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Top row of tabs and <code>.mod-top</code></h4>\n<p>The top area of the application which includes both the custom titlebar (if enabled) and the top row of tabs is considered a single UI area. The default theme uses a single background color for this top area.</p>\n<p>The <code>.mod-top</code> modifier class is added to the top row of tabs in sidebars and panes. Tab containers inside of <code>.mod-top</code> use the <code>--titlebar-background</code> variables rather than <code>--tab-container-background</code> variable.</p>\n<h4>Sidebars and sidebar buttons</h4>\n<p><strong>Note: the right ribbon has been removed</strong></p>\n<p>Sidebar toggle buttons have moved into the top row of tabs. Depending on the user‚Äôs operating system, the window buttons (minimize, maximize, close) may be on the left or right side of the application. When the user set title bar to Hidden, this means the position of the sidebar buttons needs to be accounted for.</p>\n<p>Consider the following scenarios, particularly when titlebar is hidden, on macOS vs. Windows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Left sidebar closed</li>\n<li>Right sidebar closed</li>\n<li>Popout widow does not have sidebars</li>\n<li>Fullscreen does not have window buttons</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>View header</h4>\n<p><strong>The view header is now disabled by default and the <code>view-header-icon</code> has been removed</strong></p>\n<p>Users can re-enable the view header in <code>Appearance</code> settings.</p>\n<h2>Design guidelines</h2>\n<p>Starting with 1.0, the default Obsidian experience is designed to be consistent with operating system design guidelines and best practices. Our intention is to make Obsidian feel familiar to new users, and create cohesiveness across the screens and modes of the application.</p>\n<p>We encourage plugin developers to follow these design guidelines so that users have a cohesive experience when using the default theme.</p>\n<h4>Padding, margins and spacing</h4>\n<p>Obsidian uses a 4 pixel grid. The 4 pixel grid is chosen because it enables the interface to scale up and down across high/low DPI screens, and also provides convenient ratios for layouts.</p>\n<p>UI elements use multiples of 4 for padding and spacing throughout the app. We recommend using the <code>--size</code> CSS variables to define all dimensions throughout your plugin.</p>\n<p>Each size variable contains two numbers which represent the base and the multiple, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>--size-4-1</code> represents <code>4*1 = 4px</code></li>\n<li><code>--size-4-2</code> represents <code>4*2 = 8px</code></li>\n<li><code>--size-4-4</code> represents <code>4*4 = 16px</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A few <code>--size-2-x</code> variables are available for small spaces where fractions of 4 can be useful, e.g. <code>--size-2-1</code> represents <code>2*1 = 2px</code></p>\n<h4>Cursor</h4>\n<p>Obsidian follows operating system conventions for cursors. This means that the <code>pointer</code> cursor is only used when hovering over links. Avoid using the <code>pointer</code> cursor for buttons and interactive elements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <code>--cursor</code> variable to follow system conventions</li>\n<li>Use <code>--cursor-link</code> for links</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Icons</h4>\n<p><strong>Important: In a future update to Obsidian, we will provide a new way for themes to replace icons. For now you should avoid replacing icons via CSS</strong></p>\n<p>Obsidian includes the <a href=\"https://lucide.dev/\">Lucide</a> icon library, which has over 800 icons that you can use for your plugin.</p>\n<p>If you are looking to use an icon that is not available in the Lucide library, you can create your own. For best compatibility and cohesiveness with Obsidian, your icons should <a href=\"https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/blob/main/docs/ICON_DESIGN_GUIDE.md\">follow Lucide‚Äôs guidelines</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Icons must be designed on a 24 by 24 pixels canvas</li>\n<li>Icons must have at least 1 pixel padding within the canvas</li>\n<li>Icons must have a stroke width of 2 pixels</li>\n<li>Icons must use round joins</li>\n<li>Icons must use round caps</li>\n<li>Icons must use centered strokes</li>\n<li>Shapes (such as rectangles) in icons must have border radius of 2 pixels</li>\n<li>Distinct elements must have 2 pixels of spacing between each other</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lucide also <a href=\"https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">provides templates and guides</a> for vector editors such as Illustrator, Figma, and Inkscape.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>With the desktop release of <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/changelog/2022-06-14-desktop-v0.15.0/\">Obsidian v0.15</a>, we're introducing a new way of putting panes into pop-out windows. For most plugins adding simple DOM based plugin views, this should work out-of-the-box.</p>\n<p>However, there are some things that work differently when your plugin renders things in pop-out windows.</p>\n<p>Pop-out windows come with a complete different set of globals. It has its own <code>Window</code> object, <code>Document</code> object, and fresh copies of all global constructors (like <code>HTMLElement</code> and <code>MouseEvent</code>).</p>\n<p>This means that some of the things you previously had assumed to be global and can have only one, will now only work in the main window. Here are some examples:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let myElement: HTMLElement = ...;\n\n// this will always append to the main window\ndocument.body.appendChild(myElement);\n\n// this will actually be false if element is in a pop-out window\nif (myElement instanceof HTMLElement) {\n\n}\n\nelement.on('click', '.my-css-class', (event) =&gt; {\n    // This will be false if the event is triggered in a pop-out window\n    if (event instanceof MouseEvent) {\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>To facilitate plugins, <a href=\"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/master/obsidian.d.ts\">we've updated the Obsidian API</a> to include various helper function and accessors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A global <a href=\"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/b9bde9e32c007eb28c0fd632cf2c42b01dfd022a/obsidian.d.ts#L222\"><code>activeWindow</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/b9bde9e32c007eb28c0fd632cf2c42b01dfd022a/obsidian.d.ts#L227\"><code>activeDocument</code></a> variable, which always points to the current focused window and its document.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/b9bde9e32c007eb28c0fd632cf2c42b01dfd022a/obsidian.d.ts#L60\"><code>element.win</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/b9bde9e32c007eb28c0fd632cf2c42b01dfd022a/obsidian.d.ts#L56\"><code>element.doc</code></a>, which points to the Window and Document objects that the element belongs to.</li>\n<li>A function for performing cross-window compatible <code>instanceof</code> checks. Use <a href=\"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/b9bde9e32c007eb28c0fd632cf2c42b01dfd022a/obsidian.d.ts#L50\"><code>element.instanceOf(HTMLElement)</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/b9bde9e32c007eb28c0fd632cf2c42b01dfd022a/obsidian.d.ts#L200\"><code>event.instanceOf(MouseEvent)</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/b9bde9e32c007eb28c0fd632cf2c42b01dfd022a/obsidian.d.ts#L181\"><code>HTMLElement.onWindowMigrated(callback)</code></a> which hooks an event on the element for when it is inserted into a different window than it originally was in. This can be used for complex renderers like canvases to re-initialize the rendering context.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using the new APIs, the previous example would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let myElement: HTMLElement = ...;\n\n// this will append myElement to the same window as someElement\nsomeElement.doc.body.appendChild(myElement);\n\n// this will work correctly in pop-out windows\nif (myElement.instanceOf(HTMLElement)) {\n\n}\n\nelement.on('click', '.my-css-class', (event) =&gt; {\n    // this will work correctly in pop-out windows\n    if (event.instanceOf(MouseEvent)) {\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>CodeMirror 6.0 is finally stable. That means Obsidian will be migrating from CM6 v0.19 to v6.0 soon.</p>\n<p>In this post I will attempt to summarize everything you need to know about this upcoming migration with breaking changes.</p>\n<p>When you upgrade your plugin to target CM6 v6.0, there is a possibility that it no longer works with older versions of Obsidian using CM6 v0.19. If this is the case, you should update your plugin's <code>manifest.json</code> to indicate that your <code>minAppVersion</code> is <code>0.15.0</code>, and also add the appropriate entries to <code>versions.json</code> to prevent users with older versions of Obsidian to upgrade your plugin.</p>\n<p>Major changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Prec.fallback/override/extend</code> is now <code>Prec.highest/high/lowest</code>.</li>\n<li><code>blockAtHeight</code>, <code>visualLineAtHeight</code>, <code>viewportLines</code>, <code>visualLineAt</code> are now deprecated. The replacements work slightly differently but they should be <a href=\"https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#view.EditorView.lineBlockAtHeight\"><code>lineBlockAtHeight</code></a>, <a href=\"https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#view.EditorView.viewportLineBlocks\"><code>viewportLineBlocks</code></a> and <a href=\"https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#view.EditorView.lineBlockAt\"><code>lineBlockAt</code></a>.</li>\n<li>Syntax trees <code>iterate</code> function has changed signature from 3 parameters <code>(node, from, to)</code> to a single object parameter <code>(obj: {node, type, from, to})</code> (<a href=\"https://lezer.codemirror.net/docs/ref/#common.SyntaxNodeRef\">details</a>)</li>\n<li><code>scrollPosIntoView</code>, <code>scrollTo</code>, and <code>centerOn</code> is now <a href=\"https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#view.EditorView%5EscrollIntoView\"><code>scrollIntoView</code></a></li>\n<li>Plugin fields no longer exist, and providing decorations from a view plugin now happens by providing a function to the <a href=\"https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#view.EditorView%5Edecorations\"><code>EditorView.decorations</code></a> facet. Same for atomic ranges and scroll margins ‚Äî you must use a facet for them now.</li>\n<li>Many packages has been merged into other packages:\n<ul>\n<li><code>text</code> and <code>rangeset</code> are merged into <code>state</code>.</li>\n<li><code>tooltip</code>, <code>gutter</code>, <code>panel</code>, and <code>rectangular-selection</code> are merged into <code>view</code>.</li>\n<li><code>matchbrackets</code>, <code>stream-parser</code>, <code>fold</code> are merged into <code>language</code>. The custom exports from <code>stream-parser</code> are now available at <a href=\"https://github.com/lishid/cm-language\"><code>lishid/cm-language</code></a>.</li>\n<li><code>comment</code> and <code>history</code> are merged into <code>commands</code>.</li>\n<li><code>closebrackets</code> is merged into <code>autocomplete</code>.</li>\n<li><code>highlight</code> is split into <code>language</code> and <code>@lezer/highlight</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more minor changes, check out <a href=\"https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/release-0-20-0/4302\">the full breaking release notes</a>.</p>\n",

			"title": "Live Preview update",
			"content_html": "<p>Obsidian 0.13 introduces a brand new editor engine that comes with several enhancements to your editing experience. In this post, we'll take a closer look at one of the biggest improvements in the latest release: <em>Live Preview</em>.</p>\n<p>Live Preview is a new editor mode that lets you preview your notes in the same view that you're writing them in. Live Preview delivers a cleaner writing experience by only displaying Markdown syntax around the cursor. Let's see an example!</p>\n<p>This is what your editing experience used to look like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/f786db9fac45774fa4f0d8112e232d67/Attachments/Source%20view.png\" alt=\"Source view\" /></p>\n<p>And here's the same note using Live Preview:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/f786db9fac45774fa4f0d8112e232d67/Attachments/Live%20preview.gif\" alt=\"Livew Preview\" /></p>\n<p>Live Preview gives you an improved editing experience that lets you see how your Markdown note will look like, without having to switch between Edit and Preview.</p>\n<p>To enable Live Preview for an existing vault:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar, click <strong>Editor</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>General</strong>, disable <strong>Legacy Editor</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Relaunch</strong> button for the change to take effect.</li>\n<li>After Obsidian restarts, open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar, click <strong>Editor</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>General</strong>, set <strong>Default editing mode</strong> to <strong>Live Preview</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you open a new pane, it'll use Live Preview by default. If you already have some panes open, they'll be in <em>Source mode</em>.</p>\n<h2>Edit notes using Live Preview or Source mode</h2>\n<p>We think you're going to love Live Preview. But if you want to keep your current editing experience, we've got you covered. You can keep editing your notes the same way as before by switching to the new Source mode.</p>\n<p>To toggle between Live Preview and Source mode:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the upper right corner of the pane, click <strong>More options</strong> (the three dots).</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Toggle source/live preview mode</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can also toggle the editing view by opening the Command palette and searching for the <strong>Toggle source/live preview mode command</strong>, or change it permanently by setting <strong>Default editing mode</strong> to Source mode.</p>\n<p>Live Preview and Source mode are two ways to edit your Markdown notes in Obsidian. Try them out to see which one you prefer!</p>\n<p>If you want to know how the terminology changes with the new features, here's a handy chart by Argentum:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/f786db9fac45774fa4f0d8112e232d67/Attachments/Editor%20update%20chart.png\" alt=\"Editor update chart\" /></p>\n<h2>Wait, I'm not ready to switch!</h2>\n<p>Some plugins and themes may not be fully compatible with the new editor. If your favorite plugin doesn't yet support the new editor, you can switch back to the old one by enabling the Legacy editor.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar, click <strong>Editor</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>General</strong>, enable <strong>Legacy Editor</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Relaunch</strong> button for the change to take effect.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Use the legacy editor if you're not ready to upgrade to the new editor. You'll miss out some sweet features, but know that you can switch to the new editor at any time.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>This is a heads-up that early bird discount for both Obsidian Sync and Obsidian Publish will end on September 30, 2021.</p>\n<p>We waited a bit to end the early bird discount in order to accommodate back-to-school season, so if Obsidian helps with your studies, right now would be a good time to grab either services. We‚Äôre a small team who depends on people like you to spread the word to grow, so please please recommend Obsidian to your classmates and peers if you find helpful, thank you so much!</p>\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I live in another time zone. Which time zone is the deadline in?</strong></p>\n<p>A: We understand the end of September 30 is not the same time everywhere in the world. As long as you pay before the end of that day in your local time zone, you will be fine.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I‚Äôm paying via PayPal and haven‚Äôt received my instructions, will I miss the early bird discount?</strong></p>\n<p>A: As long as you send an email to us before September 30 in your local time, you can get it! It might take some time to process all the requests but you will still qualify.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I‚Äôm paying via Wechat and have not received my service before September, will I miss the early bird discount?</strong></p>\n<p>A: As long as you send the payment and email us before September 30 in your local time, you will get early bird discount for life.</p>\n<p><strong>Q : Can I switch from monthly to yearly or yearly to monthly after the discount ends?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, you can switch without losing the discount.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: If I buy Sync now, will I have discount for Publish?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, the discounts work separately. The Publish discount doesn‚Äôt work for Sync either.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: If I stop renewing my subscription after getting the early bird discount, will I still have it?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, your account will always have the discount even after you stop renewing. But you need to pay at least once; if you refund all the payments, you will lose the early bird discount.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do I have to buy Sync and Publish? Are there free alternatives?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, you don‚Äôt have to buy them to sync or publish your vault. Their selling points are convenience and easy setup.</p>\n<p>To synchronize your vault between devices, you can use any sync solution that works on local folders, such as Dropbox, iCloud, and Google Drive. For mobile, you may need apps like DropSync to help with syncing, although iCloud can work for iOS.</p>\n<p>To publish your vault is a more technical task. Fortunately Markdown is a developer favorite, and there are lots of popular tools to convert Markdown into static, ready-to-publish sites like Hugo, Jekyll, and Quartz.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: If i purchased an Obsdian publish for one site, will be the early bird price apply for additional sites after September 30th?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, as long as you‚Äôve purchased Publish by the end of September, your account will be grandfathered for early bird rates and the discount will apply for any additional sites you purchase under the same account.</p>\n",
