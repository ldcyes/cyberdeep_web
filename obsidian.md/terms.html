			<h2 class="tracking-wide">General</h2>

			<h3 class="tracking-wide">Terms of Service</h3>

			<p>These Terms of Service (“<b>Terms of Service</b>”) govern your access to and use of DYNALIST INC. (the
				“<b>Company</b>,” “<b>us</b>,” “<b>we</b>,” and “<b>our</b>”) software and services including the
				OBSIDIAN software and any other
				software, services, features, products, content, applications and training offered by us from time to
				time (collectively the “<b>Services</b>”) identified in one or more agreements made available by us from
				time
				to time (each an “Access Agreement” and collectively, the “<b>Access Agreements</b>”).</p>

			<h3 class="tracking-wide">Acceptance</h3>

			<p>By using or accessing the Services or OBSIDIAN, you accept and agree to be bound by (i) these Terms of
				Service, (ii) all Access Agreements to which you are party, which are hereby incorporated herein by
				reference, and (iii) our Privacy Policy, found at <a href="privacy.html">https://obsidian.md/privacy</a>
				(the “<b>Privacy Policy</b>”) which is incorporated herein by reference (collectively referred to as the
				“<b>Agreement</b>”). </p>

			<p>This Agreement constitutes a binding agreement between the Customer (“<b>Customer</b>,” “<b>you</b>,” and
				“<b>your</b>”) and the Company. This Agreement represents the parties’ entire understanding regarding
				the Services and
				shall govern over any prior oral or written agreement or discussions or different or additional terms or
				conditions of any purchase order, invoice or other non-Company ordering document. No other terms or
				conditions of any purchase order, invoice or other non-Company ordering document shall apply to the
				Services.</p>

			<p>The Company may modify, supplement or amend these Terms and Conditions. If you have an account with us,
				you will be notified by email and given an opportunity to accept the changes.</p>


			<h2 class="tracking-wide">License</h2>

			<p>Subject to your compliance with this Agreement and your payment of any applicable fees, the Company
				grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, worldwide right to access and use the purchased Services
				in accordance with the terms set out in this Agreement (the “<b>License</b>”).</p>

			<p>The License is granted on a per-user basis and is valid for use on all supported operating systems. A
				License may be used on multiple computers and operating systems, provided that only the proper
				registered user of such License accesses or makes use of the applicable Services.</p>

			<p>Licenses are non-transferrable and may not be distributed, sold, rented, leased or otherwise assigned or
				transferred to any third party(ies).</p>

			<h3 class="tracking-wide">Obsidian</h3>

			<p>A. <em>Personal Use</em>. A License permits use of OBSIDIAN for free for your own, private,
				non-commercial
				purposes (e.g. taking notes, doing research) (“<b>Personal Use</b>”). For the avoidance of doubt, the
				use of
				OBSIDIAN for the exercise of your own trade or profession for which you are compensated compensation
				(e.g. teamwork with colleagues, writing work reports, etc.) does not qualify as Personal Use.</p>

			<p>B. <em>De Minimis Commercial Use</em>. A License permits use of OBSIDIAN for free for non-Personal Use by
				individuals, sole proprietorships, or other one-person organizations.</p>

			<p>C. <em>Not For Profit Use</em>. A License permits use of OBSIDIAN for free by registered charitable and
				not-for-profit organizations; provided, that such use is not in connection with non-Personal Use by any
				other Person.</p>

			<p>D. <em>Commercial Use</em>. In all other circumstances, a License permits the use of OBSIDIAN only after
				payment
				of all associated fees with respect to each individual/user of OBSIDIAN; provided, that the fees
				associated with a License are not required for a period of no more than fourteen (14) days for testing
				and evaluation purposes only.</p>

			<h3 class="tracking-wide">Catalyst</h3>

			<p>CATALYST is a special purpose license granting early access to exclusive OBSIDIAN versions. CATALYST is
				not required for personal use of OBSIDIAN.</p>

			<h3 class="tracking-wide">Not Professional Advice</h3>

			<p>OBSIDIAN and our other Services assist you to take notes and build a digital knowledge base. However, any
				materials available through OBSIDIAN and/or other Services and any information, training and/or advice
				provided, (collectively, the "Service Materials") are for informational purposes only; they are not
				guaranteed to be correct, complete or up-to-date, and use and work product resulting from the use of
				OBSIDIAN and our other Services will be yours. You understand that our providing of OBSIDIAN and any
				other Services to you does not constitute any guarantee of a particular outcome or otherwise make us
				responsible in any way for the success or failure of any project you undertake in connection with the
				use of OBSIDIAN and any other Services.</p>

			<h3 class="tracking-wide">Use of Services</h3>

			<p>You may use the Services only if you have reached the age of majority where you live, and you can form
				legally binding contracts under applicable law. You may not use the Services if you live in a
				jurisdiction where access to or use of the Services or any part of them may be illegal or prohibited. It
				is solely your responsibility to determine whether your use of the website is lawful, and you must
				comply with all applicable laws. </p>

			<p>You are prohibited from contributing, posting or transmitting to the Services any infringing, unlawful,
				threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, indecent, inflammatory, pornographic or profane content or
				any content that could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offence, give
				rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any law. Any content you contribute, post or transmit to
				the Services may not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial
				solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of “spam.” You may not use a false e-mail
				address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of a card or other
				content. The Company reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content, but
				does not regularly review posted content.</p>

			<p>In its sole discretion, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the Company and without
				any liability whatsoever, at any time and without notice may terminate or restrict your access to any
				component of obsidian.md.</p>

			<h2 class="tracking-wide">Fees and Payment</h2>

			<h3 class="tracking-wide">Fees</h3>

			<p>You agree to pay all fees set out in an Access Agreement. All fees are non-cancellable and non-refundable
				and are based on Services purchased and not actual usage. Unless otherwise agreed between you and us,
				charges may be paid by credit card, electronic funds transfer or bank/wire transfer. For the avoidance
				of doubt, you shall not be entitled to any refund in the event of unused Services.</p>

			<h3 class="tracking-wide">Payment Terms</h3>

			<p>Unless otherwise set out in the Access Agreement, Service fees are payable at the time of entrance into
				an Access Agreement. All fees are exclusive of taxes, levies or duties imposed by taxing authorities,
				and Customer shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies or duties (excluding taxes based
				on the Company’s income), even if such amounts are not listed on an Access Agreement. Customer shall pay
				all fees in Canadian Dollars or in such other currency as agreed to in writing by the parties without
				set-off or deduction.</p>

			<h3 class="tracking-wide">Suspension Rights</h3>

			<p>We reserve the right to immediately terminate the Services if: (i) the billing or contact information
				provided by you is false or fraudulent; or (ii) you fail to make any payment due within ten business
				days after we have provided you with notice of such failure. Any suspension of the Services by us under
				this section shall not relieve you of your payment obligations under this Agreement. We will not be
				liable to you nor to any third party for any suspension of the Services resulting from your non-payment
				of fees.</p>

			<h2 class="tracking-wide">Content and Ownership</h2>

			<h3 class="tracking-wide">Content</h3>

			<p>The Services contains Content owned by the Company, its suppliers or licensors (“<b>Company Content</b>”).
				The Company, its suppliers and licensors own and retain all rights, including all intellectual property
				rights, in and to the Services and the Content. The Services and Content are protected by copyright,
