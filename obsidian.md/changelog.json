			"content_html": "<p>This update focuses on improving a few long-standing sore points. Notably, we overhauled <strong>support for right-to-left (RTL) languages</strong>. The editor now automatically detects language direction per line, making it more adaptable for mixed-language usage. In addition, when the app is set to an RTL language, the interface is mirrored accordingly.</p>\n<p>We've improved the editing and reading experience of <strong>footnotes</strong>. This release is jam-packed with bug fixes and small improvements. This release includes numerous bug fixes and small improvements, along with some performance enhancements for loading and editing.</p>\n<h4>Highlights</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>RTL UI and mixed-direction support.

By default, Sync now syncs:\n<ul>\n<li>Main settings</li>\n<li>Appearance settings</li>\n<li>Hotkeys</li>\n<li>Core plugins</li>\n<li>Core plugin settings</li>\n<li>Video, images, PDFs, and audio</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Arbitrary files inside plugin folders are no longer tracked by Sync.

toggle is no longer displayed when using 'adapt to system'.</li>\n<li>Improved drag and drop for the command palette reordering.</li>\n<li>Fixed reorder handler not working in pop-out windows.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Search</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Search suggestions are dismissed when typing quoted string.</li>\n<li>Search suggestions are not shown unless the cursor is at the end of the query, or the next character is a space.</li>\n<li>Clicking the &quot;clear&quot; button no longer causes the search input to lose focus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Localization</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Norsk language is now mapped to the Bokmål locale.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Table</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Clicking in margin to right of table now focuses the editor.</li>\n<li>Fixed shift + arrow key not responding.</li>\n<li>Ensure cell updates from main editor correctly update cell offsets.</li>\n<li>Fix parsing math blocks inside table cells.</li>\n<li>Fixed double-click not working in table cells.</li>\n<li>Fixed rendering tables inside callouts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Source mode</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed pressing <code>End</code> key not moving to end of line if cursor is in table.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Live Preview</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix callout menu overlapping with URL menu when right-clicking on a link.</li>\n<li>Fix failing to render headings with trailing <code>#</code> at the end of the line.</li>\n<li>Fixed checklist items getting unfolded if cursor was inside a folded region.</li>\n<li>Allow blank lines in multi-line footnotes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reading mode</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading mode no longer renders footnote references that contain spaces.</li>\n<li>Fixed rendering of inline footnotes in reading mode.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>PDF</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Mitigation for PDF.js vulnerability (<a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wgrm-67xf-hhpq\">CVE-2024-4367</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Developers</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We have published <a href=\"https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/User+interface/Right-to-left\">a guide</a> for how to adapt your theme or plugin to support RTL interfaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Themes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Switched to Cascadia Mono instead of Cascadia Code as the default monospace on Windows.</li>\n<li>Bold text is now computed based on the current text weight, so bold inside a heading still appears bold.\n<ul>\n<li>For theming we recommend using the <code>--bold-modifier</code> variable instead of <code>--bold-weight</code>. This enables Obsidian to use a heavier weight in situations where the text may already be bold, such as headings: <code>## Bold **bolder**</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Added <code>--caret-color</code> CSS variable to make it easier to style caret color on both desktop and mobile.</li>\n<li>Added new <code>--link-weight</code> variable.</li>\n<li>The user's interface language is added to the <code>lang</code> attribute on the <code>html</code> element, which allows language-specific CSS rules.</li>\n<li>The <code>.mod-rtl</code> class is added to <code>body</code> element when the user's interface language is RTL.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Plugins</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed <code>processFrontmatter</code> not processing files if all properties are removed.</li>\n<li>Improved detection of external config changes.</li>\n<li>Improved <code>app.emulateMobile</code> to make it easier to test if your plugins are mobile-compatible. Attempting to run a NodeJS library presents a Notice. Drag-and-drop more accurately mirrors mobile behavior. The app has default <code>safe-area-inset</code> properties set so that your views properly account for offsets in the mobile device viewport (such as the iPhone Dynamic Island).</li>\n<li>Modals should respect <code>safe-area-insets</code> without requiring additional CSS.</li>\n<li>Added loading state to some settings buttons that make remote requests.</li>\n<li>Completely removed global <code>app</code> from the API spec (previously it was marked as deprecated).</li>\n</ul>\n",

Attempting to run a NodeJS library will present a Notice. Drag and drop will more accurately mirror the behavior on mobile. The app will have default <code>safe-area-inset</code> properties set so that your views properly account for offsets in the mobile device viewport (such as the iPhone Dynamic Island).</li>\n<li>Bare modals should respect <code>safe-area-insets</code> by default.</li>\n<li>Added loading state to some of the settings button that make remote requests.</li>\n<li>Global <code>app</code> has been completely removed from the API spec (previously it was marked as deprecated).</li>\n</ul>\n",

			"content_html": "<h2>Shiny new things</h2>\n<p>Introducing a brand new editor for Markdown tables. Table rows and columns are now easier to create, edit, sort, reorder, select, copy, and paste. These new table features can also be accessed via context menu, command palette, and hotkeys. Tables are still saved to plain text Markdown.</p>\n<p><video src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/693981/284392728-eeb5609f-0622-4a3b-b514-c35993703fa7.mp4\" autoplay=\"true\" muted=\"muted\" style=\"max-height:400px; min-height: 200px\" class=\"rounded-lg\"></video></p>\n<p>To add a table to a note, right click and choose <em>Insert → Table</em>, or use the command palette.</p>\n<p>Once you insert a table, you can add new columns and rows by clicking on the sides of the table. Add text with inline formatting. Press <code>tab</code> to navigate between cells.</p>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<h3>Properties</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Properties can now be renamed globally. Renaming will cause the property to be modified in each corresponding file and the search is case-insensitive.</li>\n<li>Global Search: Search now works with non-string property values. Search for boolean values <code>[property:TRUE]</code> or <code>[property:FALSE]</code> or empty values <code>[property:EMPTY]</code>. You can also use inequality operators to search for things like <code>[some_property:&gt;10]</code>.</li>\n<li>Global properties view can now be filtered.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Editing experience</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New formatting menu. You can now right click in the editor to change text formatting, paragraph styles, and insert elements such as lists and tables.</li>\n<li>Right-click on a callout to quickly change the callout type from a list of default callout type options.</li>\n<li>Pressing <code>Tab</code> when the <code>#</code> autocomplete is active will autocomplete the highlighted suggestion. If the highlighted suggestion has a <code>/</code> in it, like &quot;#projects/in-review&quot;, <code>Tab</code> will autocomplete by <em>segment</em>, so &quot;#projects&quot; then press again to get &quot;/in-review&quot;.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sync</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When viewing the version history for a file, changes made by the same user on the same device will now be grouped together. And Markdown will be rendered to more closely match reading mode.</li>\n<li>Number of vaults has increased from 5 to 10</li>\n<li>Maximum file size has increased from 100MB to 200MB</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-help/assets/10565871/bf2334dd-6add-4dfa-9adb-67ff183746ec\" alt=\"Sync version history\" /></p>\n<h3>Quality of life</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Outline view now has a &quot;collapse all&quot; button as well as a search field for filtering the list of headings in the file.</li>\n<li>Files from outside Obsidian can now be dropped anywhere in the File Explorer pane instead of on top of the vault name. Similarly, dropping a file on top of any item in a folder will cause the file to get imported into that particular folder.</li>\n<li>Pressing <code>Ctrl/Command-F</code> in any view with a search input (including Backlinks or Properties) will now focus the search input.</li>\n<li>Menu options within the <code>...</code> pane menu (the <code>...</code> in the tab header) as well as the tab menu (right clicking on a tab) have been cleaned up and should now show more relevant options.</li>\n<li>Copy, cut, and paste items in the Bookmarks view (works via hotkey only currently).</li>\n<li>Bookmarks: Removed the &quot;Bookmark this block...&quot; context menu item.</li>\n<li>Added new &quot;Show trash&quot; command to open the .trash folder in filesystem.</li>\n<li>The Appearance section in settings has been reordered for clarity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Onboarding</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Obsidian will now use the system setting for light or dark mode by default, you can change this in Appearance settings.</li>\n<li>Improved the experience when creating a new vault from scratch. If you select &quot;Create new vault,&quot; the created vault will include a <code>welcome.md</code> file and show a side-by-side view with the Graph view.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The active context menu is now automatically dismissed when the view navigates away or a dialog appears.</li>\n<li>Clicking 'New file' on an empty tab should open the new file in the current tab instead of creating a new one.</li>\n<li>Properties: Fixed issue where properties view sometimes displayed a stale value when switching between files.</li>\n<li>Properties: Fixed bug where pressing the left arrow key (<code>←</code>) the start the input would cause the input to lose focus.</li>\n<li>Word count and character count status bar items now ignore frontmatter.</li>\n<li>Bookmarks: Fixed several edge cases where drag and drop would fail to work, including dragging an item to the bottom of the bookmark list.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug where canceling a drag would not cause the actively hovered element to remove its styling.</li>\n<li>Unclosed <code>[[</code> will no longer cause the next line to get rendered as a link.</li>\n<li>Updated &quot;Auto pair brackets&quot; behavior so that <code>[[link]]'s</code> can be typed without the apostrophe getting paired.</li>\n<li>Hover preview is no longer positioned on top of the cursor or target element if there isn't enough room to display the preview box.</li>\n<li>Editor selection no longer loses focus when resizing a tab group.</li>\n<li>Search: Minor tweak to avoid the content shifting a lot as the search counter ticks upward.</li>\n<li>Vim: Fixed issue with character movements not respective atomic ranges.</li>\n<li>Vim: Fixed issue where <code>O</code> on the first line of a file with properties would put the cursor in the wrong position.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Developers</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>As of 1.5.0, the <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/blog/goodbye-legacy-editor/\">Legacy editor has been completely removed</a> from Obsidian.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/CSS+variables/Editor/Table\">New CSS table variables for selection and dragging</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>File Explorer and Tags pane both received a small code refactor. This might affect some plugins that rely on the internal JS structure. Themes should not be affected.</li>\n<li>Tags can no longer end in a <code>/</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n",

			"content_html": "<h2>Shiny new things</h2>\n<p>Brand new editor for Markdown <strong>tables</strong>. Table rows and columns are now easier to create, edit, sort, reorder, select, copy, and paste. These new table features can also be accessed via context menu, command palette, and hotkeys. Tables are still saved to plain text Markdown.</p>\n<p><video src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/693981/284392728-eeb5609f-0622-4a3b-b514-c35993703fa7.mp4\" autoplay=\"true\" muted=\"muted\" style=\"max-height:400px; min-height: 200px\" class=\"rounded-lg\"></video></p>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<h3>Onboarding experience</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Obsidian will now use the system setting for light or dark mode by default, you can change this in Appearance settings.</li>\n<li>Improved the experience when creating a new vault from scratch. If you select &quot;Create new vault,&quot; the created vault will include a <code>welcome.md</code> file and show a side-by-side view with the Graph view.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Properties</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Properties can now be renamed globally. Renaming will cause the property to be modified in each corresponding file and the search is case-insensitive.</li>\n<li>Global Search: Search now works with non-string property values. Search for boolean values <code>[property:TRUE]</code> or <code>[property:FALSE]</code> or empty values <code>[property:EMPTY]</code>. You can also use inequality operators to search for things like <code>[some_property:&gt;10]</code>.</li>\n<li>Global properties view can now be filtered.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Editing experience</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Live Preview: Right-click on a callout to quickly change the callout type from a list of default callout type options.</li>\n<li>Numbered list markers are now right-aligned in editing mode.</li>\n<li>Pressing <code>Tab</code> when the <code>#</code> autocomplete is active will autocomplete the highlighted suggestion. If the highlighted suggestion has a <code>/</code> in it, like &quot;#projects/in-review&quot;, <code>Tab</code> will autocomplete by <em>segment</em>, so &quot;#projects&quot; then press again to get &quot;/in-review&quot;.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quality of life</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Files from outside Obsidian can now be dropped anywhere in the File Explorer pane instead of on top of the vault name. Similarly, dropping a file on top of any item in a folder will cause the file to get imported into that particular folder.</li>\n<li>Pressing <code>Ctrl/Command-F</code> in any view with a search input (including Backlinks or Properties) will now focus the search input.</li>\n<li>Menu options within the <code>...</code> pane menu (the <code>...</code> in the tab header) as well as the tab menu (right clicking on a tab) have been cleaned up and should now show more relevant options.</li>\n<li>Copy, cut, and paste items in the Bookmarks view (works via hotkey only currently).</li>\n<li>Bookmarks: Removed the &quot;Bookmark this block...&quot; context menu item.</li>\n<li>Added new &quot;Show trash&quot; command to open the .trash folder in filesystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The active context menu is now automatically dismissed when the view navigates away or a dialog appears.</li>\n<li>Clicking 'New file' on an empty tab should open the new file in the current tab instead of creating a new one.</li>\n<li>Properties: Fixed issue where properties view sometimes displayed a stale value when switching between files.</li>\n<li>Properties: Fixed bug where pressing the left arrow key (<code>←</code>) the start the input would cause the input to lose focus.</li>\n<li>Word count and character count status bar items now ignore frontmatter.</li>\n<li>Bookmarks: Fixed several edge cases where drag and drop would fail to work, including dragging an item to the bottom of the bookmark list.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug where canceling a drag would not cause the actively hovered element to remove its styling.</li>\n<li>The Appearance section in settings has been reordered for clarity.</li>\n<li>Unclosed <code>[[</code> will no longer cause the next line to get rendered as a link.</li>\n<li>Updated &quot;Auto pair brackets&quot; behavior so that <code>[[link]]'s</code> can be typed without the apostrophe getting paired.</li>\n<li>Hover preview is no longer positioned on top of the cursor or target element if there isn't enough room to display the preview box.</li>\n<li>Editor selection no longer loses focus when resizing a tab group.</li>\n<li>Search: Minor tweak to avoid the content shifting a lot as the search counter ticks upward.</li>\n<li>Vim: Fixed issue with character movements not respective atomic ranges.</li>\n<li>Vim: Fixed issue where <code>O</code> on the first line of a file with properties would put the cursor in the wrong position.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Developers</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>As of 1.5.0, the <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/blog/goodbye-legacy-editor/\">Legacy editor has been completely removed</a> from Obsidian.</li>\n<li>New CSS variables added:\n<ul>\n<li><code>--list-marker-align</code></li>\n<li><code>--list-marker-min-width</code></li>\n<li><code>--indentation-guide-editing-indent</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/CSS+variables/Editor/Table\">New table variables for selection and dragging</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>File Explorer and Tags pane both received a small code refactor. This might affect some plugins that rely on the internal JS structure. Themes should not be affected.</li>\n<li>Tags can no longer end in a <code>/</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>This update introduces Properties, a simple and durable way to add tags, links, dates, and other metadata to your notes. The core plugins Search, Templates, and Backlinks have all received upgrades to support Properties. Some of the new features in this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new UI for editing properties, with autocomplete for property names and values</li>\n<li>Properties can have types (e.g. text, list, date, number, checkbox) that make it faster to input data</li>\n<li>Properties can contain internal links to other notes</li>\n<li>New sidebar view lists all properties in your vault, and sort by name or frequency</li>\n<li>Keyboard navigation, commands, and hotkeys</li>\n<li>Search syntax for searching notes by property and value</li>\n<li>Templates automatically merge properties with existing properties in the note</li>\n<li>Data is still stored as YAML frontmatter at the top of each Markdown file. Metadata is automatically formatted as valid YAML.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With this update you can also enable two-factor authentication for your Obsidian account.</p>\n<h2>Properties</h2>\n<img alt=\"Property Editor\" src=\"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/assets/693981/aea72173-5663-459d-83de-6ff888f6bdd5\" />\n<p>Properties help you organize information about a note. Adding properties to a note helps you track structured data such as text, links, dates and numbers. Properties can also be used in combination with Community plugins that can do useful things with your structured data. <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties\">Learn more.</a></p>\n<h3>Basic usage</h3>\n<p>To add a property to a note, you have several options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the <strong>Add file property</strong> command.</li>\n<li>Use the <strong><code>Cmd/Ctrl+;</code></strong> hotkey.</li>\n<li>Choose <strong>Add file property</strong> from the <strong>More actions</strong> menu (three dots icon) or right-clicking the tab.</li>\n<li>Type <code>---</code> at the very beginning of a file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you add a property, a row will appear at the top of the file with two inputs: the property <em>name</em> and the property <em>value</em>. Once you choose the property name you can give it a value and type.</p>\n<h3>Advanced usage</h3>\n<p>In addition to the inline property editor, there is a new <strong>Properties view</strong> core plugin that adds two new views for managing your properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All properties</strong> sidebar view shows a list of all the properties across your vault, and number of uses for each. Click on a property to search for all uses of it across your vault.</li>\n<li><strong>File properties</strong>  sidebar view shows the properties for the active file. If you prefer to hide the inline property editor, you can choose to edit your file properties from the sidebar, without losing your place in the active file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Properties are an extremely powerful yet flexible feature that gives you even more ways to organize your information. See the <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties\">documentation for Properties</a> for even more information.</p>\n<h2>Two-factor authentication (2FA) for Obsidian accounts</h2>\n<p>For even more security, you can now enable two-factor authentication on your Obsidian account. To do so, go to <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/account\">obsidian.md/account</a> and enable &quot;2-factor authentication&quot;. This will prompt you with setup instructions.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> Any devices logging into Obsidian must be running v1.4.5+ to log-in using two-factor authentication.</p>\n<h2>Core plugin upgrades</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Search: New <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Search#Search+properties\">search syntax</a> for properties.\n<ul>\n<li>To find notes containing a property, use [<em>property</em>]</li>\n<li>To find notes with a property and a corresponding value, use [<em>property</em>:<em>value</em>]</li>\n<li>Both property and value allow complex sub-queries, such as parentheses for grouping, the OR operator, double-quotes for exact matching, and regex.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Templates: When using the &quot;Insert template&quot; command, properties inside template files will be merged with the current file.</li>\n<li>Backlinks: Properties with links will now properly show in backlink entries.</li>\n<li>Note Composer: Merging notes will now merge their properties.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Misc improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Search: Search autocomplete will now be shown based on the current input context.</li>\n<li>Live Preview now supports single column tables.</li>\n<li>Tag autocomplete now uses a fuzzy search algorithm.</li>\n<li>PDF: Added “Copy as quote” and “Copy annotation” context menu options</li>\n<li>PDF: Added a button to copy annotations from the annotation popup</li>\n<li>PDF: Added “Copy link to page” to PDF thumbnail context menu</li>\n<li>Editor: Formatting commands for <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, etc are now context-aware.

You can now resize multiple cards at once by dragging from the selection box. You can also <em>nudge</em> selected cards in any direction by pressing the arrow keys.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/693981/220686409-b09002a7-ba40-42df-a76e-79d513bd8526.gif\" alt=\"resize-multiple-cards\" /></p>\n<h3>Readonly mode</h3>\n<p>Once you have your cards arranged exactly how you like them, you can use the new <strong>readonly mode</strong> to lock your canvas content in place. While in readonly mode, a canvas and its contents cannot be modified.</p>\n<h3>Canvas settings</h3>\n<p>There is now a settings page for Canvas with the following configuration options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Default location for new canvas files.</li>\n<li>Use scroll wheel zoom instead of pan.</li>\n<li>Options to hide the card labels.</li>\n<li>Global setting for &quot;snap to grid&quot; and &quot;snap to objects.&quot;</li>\n<li>Configurable zoom threshold for when cards switch from showing their content to just showing the card title.</li>\n<li>Configurable behavior of <code>Ctrl/Command + Drag</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Global search support</h3>\n<p>Content from text cards will now appear as search results in the global search view.</p>\n<h3>Background images for Canvas groups</h3>\n<p>Canvas groups can now have a background image associated with them. With a group selected, press the new &quot;set background&quot; button and choose an image from your vault.</p>\n<p>The image can be set to cover the entire group or be used as a repeating pattern.</p>\n<h3>Jump to group</h3>\n<p>The new &quot;Jump to group&quot; command allows you to search for groups in your open Canvas by name. Selecting a group will quickly pan the viewport to that group.\nSome other notable improvements to Canvas:</p>\n<h3>Narrow to block</h3>\n<p>Similarly to the &quot;Narrow to heading...&quot; feature, there is now a &quot;narrow to block&quot; menu item for file cards in the Canvas. Just right-click on a file card and choose &quot;Narrow to block...&quot; to see a list of all blocks in the given file. Selecting a block from the list will change the card to only display the contents of that block.</p>\n<h2>Bug fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Deleting a file now closes its tab if there are other tabs in the tab group.</li>\n<li>Obsidian Sync's settings page will now warn you if your vault is in Dropbox, iCloud, or OneDrive. Using multiple sync providers can lead to data conflicts.</li>\n<li>&quot;Follow link under cursor&quot; commands will now create a new canvas file if the linked canvas (i.e. <code>[[dashboard.canvas]]</code>) doesn't exist. Previously a Markdown file called <code>dashboard.canvas</code> would get created.</li>\n<li>Removed the redundant 🔗 icon from the tab header for linked tabs.</li>\n<li>Fixed LaTeX syntax highlighting.</li>\n<li>Fixed Mermaid gitgraph colors.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug where embeds and code blocks in Live Preview were not properly unloaded when switching files.</li>\n<li>Fixed context menu position when using &quot;Show context menu under cursor&quot; command while &quot;native menus&quot; is enabled.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug with &quot;fold less&quot; command not unfolding content on the selected line.</li>\n<li>File BOM will now automatically be stripped when Obsidian reads a file.</li>\n<li>When editing at the bottom of the window, the view will now scroll to have enough room to show the current line of text above the status bar.</li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where dragging tabs around the workspace sometimes causes an image in your clipboard to get pasted into the open editor.</li>\n<li>Color inputs now have a focus state when selected via the keyboard.</li>\n<li>Improved Mermaid text colors.</li>\n<li>The vim Codemirror extension has been updated to include all the latest upstream fixes and patches.</li>\n<li>Code blocks in Live Preview now show a copy icon if there is no language set.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Some of the highlights include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://obsidian.md/changelog/2022-10-13-desktop-v1.0.0/#tabs\">Tabs</a> – The workspace now supports tabs. To accommodate tabs, we've made a lot of tweaks to Obsidian behaviors.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://obsidian.md/changelog/2022-10-13-desktop-v1.0.0/#tab-stacks\">Tab stacks</a> – an alternative way to view your tabs, reminiscent of <a href=\"https://notes.andymatuschak.org/\">Andy Matuschak's website</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://obsidian.md/changelog/2022-10-13-desktop-v1.0.0/#new-appearance-settings\">New appearance settings</a> – Obsidian has gone through an extensive redesign process to make the interface more robust, accessible, and easier to tinker with.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://obsidian.md/changelog/2022-10-13-desktop-v1.0.0/#additional-improvements\">Tons of other misc. improvements</a> – New 'fold' commands, an overhauled Theme Gallery, and bug fixes galore!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make sure to take a look at the <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/changelog/2022-10-13-desktop-v1.0.0/#faq\">FAQ section</a> which should address some common points of confusion as you adapt to the new Obsidian.</p>\n<h2>Tabs</h2>\n<p>With this update, we have embraced <strong>tabs</strong> throughout the UI. We've found that tabs provide a more intuitive experience for both browsing and editing notes in your vault.</p>\n<p>Tabs have had us rethinking some of the most basic interactions with Obsidian. We have taken this opportunity to consolidate the hotkeys for opening files. Combine these modifier keys when clicking on any link in Obsidian (this includes the quick switcher!) or use them with <kbd>Enter to navigate the link under the cursor.</kbd></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Action</th>\n<th>MacOS</th>\n<th>Windows/Linux</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Navigate</strong></td>\n<td><em>None</em></td>\n<td><em>None</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>New Tab</strong></td>\n<td><kbd>⌘</kbd> (+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> in Source Mode)</td>\n<td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> in Source Mode)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>New Tab Group</strong></td>\n<td><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⌥</kbd></td>\n<td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>New Window</strong></td>\n<td><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></td>\n<td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Tabs have also inspired some changes to how users browse their vaults. It felt only natural that we also introduce <strong>per-tab history</strong>. Each tab now maintains its own history for navigation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/693981/191052493-8109f1a1-411c-4b61-b435-788d0cac3231.png\" alt=\"per-tab history\" /></p>\n<h2>Tab stacks</h2>\n<p>You can now switch any tab group in your workspace into a <em>tab stack</em>. Tab stacks provide an alternative way to view your tabs, reminiscent of Andy's Mode.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/693981/188205363-0f24b2a5-3706-4a8c-b38b-7a66baa68ce6.gif\" alt=\"tab-stacks\" /></p>\n<p><em>Tab stacks</em> are, at their heart, the same as a tab group. Try mixing and matching with a tab group on one side and a tab stack on the other.</p>\n<h2>New appearance settings</h2>\n<p>We've introduced quite a few new settings at <strong>Settings → Appearance</strong>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Setting</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Show inline title</strong></td>\n<td>Notes now display the full note title inline with the note contents as an <em>Inline Title</em>. You can disable this in settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Show tab title bar</strong></td>\n<td>Show or hide the title bar at the top of very tab.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Window frame style</strong></td>\n<td>By default, the UI is now in <em>Frameless</em> mode. The window title is hidden. In settings, you can choose between the new frameless mode, the custom Obsidian frame (old default), and using the native OS window frame.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Accent color</strong></td>\n<td>There's now an &quot;accent color&quot; color-picker to give your vault its own unique style. Theme support may vary.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Zoom level</strong></td>\n<td>Controls the overall zoom level of the app.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Native menus</strong></td>\n<td>Menus will be rendered to match the context menus provided by the operating system.

If you are still seeing visual anomalies, we recommend switching to the default theme for the time being.</p>\n<h2>Shiny new things</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The workspace now supports <strong>Tabs</strong>. To accommodate tabs, we've made a lot of tweaks to Obsidian behaviors.</li>\n<li>Way more than a fresh coat of paint, Obsidian has gone through an extensive redesign process to make the interface more robust, accessible, and easier to tinker with. Internally, we've been calling this new look &quot;Dragonglass,&quot; and we'll be releasing a separate changelog to showcase all the changes that went into it.</li>\n<li>Notes now display the full note title inline with the note contents as an <strong>Inline Title</strong>. The view header is now disabled by default. You can add it back from <strong>Appearance → <em>Show view header</em></strong>.</li>\n<li>By default, the UI is now in <strong>Frameless</strong> mode. The window title is hidden. In settings, you can choose between the new frameless mode, the custom window frame (old default), and using the native OS window frame.</li>\n<li>There's now an &quot;accent color&quot; color-picker in the Appearance settings to give your vault it's own unique style. Theme support may vary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Theme Gallery has gotten a major overhaul. Themes now support versioning just like plugins.

If your plugin is attaching itself to core Suggest components or mimicking the Suggest component structure, it will likely be impacted.\n<ul>\n<li>The new DOM structure is:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>- .suggestion-item\n\t- .suggestion-content\n\t\t- .suggestion-title\n\t\t- .suggestion-note (optional)\n\t- .suggestion-aux\n\t\t- .suggestion-hotkey (optional)\n\t\t- .suggestion-flair (optional)\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>The behavior of <code>workspace.getActiveFile</code> has been updated to now return the file of the most recently active FileView. This change should improve compatibility for custom views now that sidebar views are focusable. If you were previously using <code>workspace.getMostRecentlyActiveFile</code> for v0.15.X compatibility, please switch back to <code>getActiveFile</code>.</li>\n<li>Note: Theme developers can avoid overriding the macOS native scrollbars by targeting <code>body:not(.native-scrollbars)</code> for any scrollbar styling.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Some themes may have set overrides for the font size, so this setting might not work for you.

Use backslash <code>\\&quot;</code> to escape double quotes and <code>\\\\</code> to escape backslash.</li>\n<li>Regular expressions (regex) can now be used in search. Use forward slash to denote a regular expression. For example: <code>/[a-z]{3}/</code>.</li>\n<li>Boolean operations can now be used. Use <code>OR</code> to match one or another. Use <code>-</code> to negate a query. The space character is used for boolean &quot;and&quot;.</li>\n<li>Parenthesis can be used to group boolean operations. For example <code>(a OR b) (c OR d)</code>.</li>\n<li>Several special operators are available. Some operators allow nesting queries using parenthesis, for example: <code>file:(&quot;to be&quot; OR -&quot;2B&quot;)</code>.\n<ul>\n<li><code>file:</code> will perform the following subquery on the file name.

For example: <code>file:&quot;Daily Notes/2020-07&quot;</code>.</li>\n<li><code>match-case:</code> and <code>ignore-case:</code> will override the case sensitive match logic for the following subquery.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There are now options in the search interface to provide different types of results:\n<ul>\n<li><code>Collapse results</code> will toggle between just showing matching note names and showing the lines in which matches appear. These extended results can be toggled for each note by clicking on the folding triangle next to the file name.</li>\n<li><code>Match Case</code> will do what it says, but note that it can be overridden on a per-search basis as per above.</li>\n<li><code>Explain Search Terms</code> will show you what the search is actually looking for in plain terms, so you can debug complex searches.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>And search results are now optimized to only render results visible in the scrollable box.

Once you highlight the note you want from the list, press <code>#</code> instead of <code>Enter</code> and you'll see a list of headings in that file. Press <code>#</code> again for each subheading, and <code>Enter</code> to complete the link.</li>\n<li>Related to that, if you make a link with heading specified for an embed, it will show just that section in preview mode. The hover preview will also show just that section.</li>\n<li>The OTHER big news: You can now follow links with the keyboard. By default, follow the link under the cursor with <code>alt-Enter</code>, and open in a new panel with <code>Ctrl-alt-Enter</code>, but of course these are customizable in [[Keyboard shortcuts]].</li>\n<li>You can now now search AND replace, <code>Ctrl+H</code> by default.</li>\n<li>Daily notes now have the option of using a template note. Set this in the plug-in settings.</li>\n<li>We also added commands to toggle the left and right side bars. No hotkey set by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Link suggestion now has fuzzy search. No more trying to remember what order words came in when you named that file.</li>\n<li>Both the link suggestion and the quick switcher highlight matches as you type. Yes the colors for these can be changed in CSS.</li>\n<li>When you use the Navigate Back command to return to a document, we now restore your scroll location and cursor selection.</li>\n<li>Markdown links with relative paths like <code>[link](../Note.md)</code>  now work. The path is relative to the file you're making the link in.</li>\n<li>Improved the [[Format your notes]] examples to include some of the lesser-used formats to satisfy certain CSS developers who shall remain nameless.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>No longer broken</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Long note titles are no longer truncated with ellipses, so you can actually see what you're typing when you edit them.</li>\n<li>Long headings are no longer compressed to unreadable in page preview.</li>\n<li>Star and Unstar commands are now a single toggle command.</li>\n<li>We fixed that weird table layout issue that would cause columns to resize poorly.</li>\n<li>We fixed starred notes not appearing after you delete one of them.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar, you can now close a removed pane after disabling a plugin.</li>\n<li>Linking an unlinked file no longer navigates to that file at the same time. If that makes no sense to you, you probably never saw the bug. Don't worry about it, it's fixed now.</li>\n<li>Graph view now runs a single instance in the background. This means you won't lag out the application by opening it multiple times.</li>\n</ul>\n",
